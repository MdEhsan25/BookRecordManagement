# BookRecordManagement

--A simple web application where CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) operations are performed to manage the book Records.
--PHP is used as the server side scripting language and MySQL is used as database to store the records.
--A little bit of HTML and CSS is used within PHP file to maintain view of records.
--We need to set up a local server to run this application as a localhost.
--Here I used WAMP server to run my website locally.
